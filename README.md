# Webhooks
Webhooks gives you access to the entire HTTP request, including headers, query parameters and body. 

Headers and query parameters are serialized as JSON strings, and can be accessed alongside the body as tags. Combine this app with the built-in Logic app or the HomeyScript app to do wonderful things with your data.
