# Advanced Webhooks

Advanced Webhooks gives you webhooks with access to the entire HTTP request, including headers, query parameters and body. This means that you can access these as tags, and use them in your flows.

The app also includes flows that triggers for each item in a JSON array, or each property in a JSON object. This can be helpful for splitting a single webhook into multiple events that runs through your flow.
